# Project State (v3)

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md

**Core value:** A Game Designer goes from "country + historical period" to a validated, Unity-ready map package — driven by geometry, with LLM as opt-in metadata.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — ingestion-adapter

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (ingestion-adapter) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-05-08

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (0 of 8 phases complete)

**RESUME:** see `.planning/sessions/2026-05-07-session.md` and `.planning/HANDOFF.json`. Run `/gsd-execute-phase 1` after picking a triage option. Recommended: `fix` — port emits 91 condados, golden has 92; investigate the missing condado, add `fix(01-03):` commit, re-run parity to 10/10 green, then proceed to Task 4.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See `.planning/PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table (D-V3-01 through D-V3-07).

- [Phase 01-pipeline-parity-port-harness-together]: PREFLIGHT.md Q8: original_idx ABSENT in deployed territory_metadata.json (0/92 condados). Port reproduces inicio verbatim per D-09 (deployed wins).
- [Phase 01-pipeline-parity-port-harness-together]: PREFLIGHT.md Q10: draw_names = False (deployed visual_condado.png has no labels).
- [Phase 01-pipeline-parity-port-harness-together]: RegionConfig is @dataclass (not pydantic) per RESEARCH §2.b — drift from inicio is the hard cost.
- [Phase 01-pipeline-parity-port-harness-together]: border_polygon length is 40 (verbatim from inicio:132-143) — plan/CLAUDE.md mis-counted as 38; documented as Rule 1 deviation.
- [Phase 01-pipeline-parity-port-harness-together]: ES TopoJSON sourced via npm pack es-atlas@0.6.0 (shasum 4c926d9cba); PT GeoJSON via Git LFS.
- [Phase 01]: Plan 02 verbatim port: all 8 inicio sections ported 1:1 across 9 submodules; CLI smoke produces 10 contract files with byte-deterministic SHA-256 across runs; Image.NEAREST + cfg.rng_seed + per-country KD-trees + 9999/-1 sentinels + 2x independent masks all preserved
- [Phase 01]: Windows portability fix (Rule 3 deviation): added encoding='utf-8' to ES TopoJSON open in landmask.py; inicio's POSIX-default open errors on cp1252; fix matches inicio's PT path which already uses utf-8
- [Phase 02]: Plan 02-01: ProjectDataset migration completed atomically (D-01, D-03, D-04, D-06, D-08); 5 callsites migrated; Phase 01 parity stays 10/10; 9 new unit tests
- [Phase 02]: Plan 02-02: services/pipeline/adapters/ subpackage built (4-file flat split: __init__/base/osm/terrain). build_dataset_from_osm wraps fetch_municipalities (D-05); _split_by_iso uses representative_point (Pitfall A3); build_terrain returns vendored mountain_river_data.json (D-13 stub); D-15+D-16 honored by absence. 11 unit tests + Phase 01 parity 10/10 unchanged; combined wave 21/21 green.
- [Phase 02]: Plan 02-04: D-14 implemented (GET /api/v3/projects/{id}/ingest SSE endpoint). Mirrors v1 _sse_generator pattern; wraps build_dataset_from_osm; terminal None sentinel; per-(project_id, step) stop_event; status: ingested on success, error_ingesting on cancel/exception. Legacy v1 /api/projects/{id}/ingest stays mounted (D-14 coexistence). D-13/D-15/D-16 honored by absence. 6 unit tests pass; Phase 01 parity unchanged 10/10.
- [Phase 02]: Plan 02-03 closed with Option C (defer + xfail). ROADMAP-02#1 deferred to Phase 02.1 ('Resolve live-ingestion parity contract') — vendored (es-atlas/IGE) and live (raw OSM) are different upstream sources, structural divergence cannot converge under any waiver-loop iteration. test_iberia_868_live.py xfail(strict=False); 6 xfailed + 4 xpassed, suite exit 0; Phase 01 parity 10/10 green. See D-09-LIVE-WAIVER.md.

### Blockers/Concerns

- v1 archive holds the lessons that v3 must NOT relearn. Before Phase 01 planning, re-read `.planning/v1-archive/STATE.md` for the 30+ pitfalls discovered during v1.0.
- 6 stale worktrees were removed in Phase 00 — verify `git worktree list` returns 1 line before any future agent work.
- Plan 02-03 paused at decision checkpoint: live OSM admin_level=8 ES (8179 features) is structurally larger than vendored es-atlas (~3000). Waiver-loop strategy locked in plan <approach> cannot converge. Live parity 4/10 pass, 6/10 fail (visual_condado SSIM=0.9630, visual_barony SSIM=0.9439, lookup PNGs byte-mismatch, territory_metadata.json mismatch). Phase 01 parity 10/10 green — isolation confirmed. See .planning/phases/02-ingestion-adapter/D-09-LIVE-WAIVER.md for evidence + 4 options.
